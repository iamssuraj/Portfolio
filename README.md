# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website to showcase my work and skills. The site was developed using HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a modern and visually appealing design. It features examples of my projects, a brief summary of my experience and skills. The site is easy to navigate and provides a comprehensive overview of my abilities.\
