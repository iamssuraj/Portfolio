                        (Sept 2022)</a></b> </li>
            The project focused on developing a model for detecting lung cancer using numpy, pandas, and sklearn. The
            model was trained on a dataset of patient information, and was able to accurately identify cases of lung
            cancer. The use of numpy allowed for efficient manipulation of the large amount of data, while pandas was
            used for data preprocessing and sklearn was used to train and evaluate the model. The project
            showed promising results in detecting lung cancer and has the potential to improve early detection and
            treatment of the disease.

                        2022)</a></b> </li>
            The project aimed to build a sentiment analyzer using Python’s Natural Language Toolkit
            (nltk). The nltk library was used to process the text data and extract features such as word frequency and
            sentiment score. The trained model was able to accurately predict the sentiment of text. The project
            demonstrated the effectiveness of using nltk for sentiment analysis tasks.

            <li> <b> <a href="https://iamssuraj.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Portfolio Website (Jan 2022)</a></b> </li>
            This is the website that you are looking at. &#128514; This is my portfolio website to showcase my work and
            skills. The site was developed using HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a modern and
            visually appealing design. It features examples of my projects, a brief summary of my experience and skills.
            The site is easy to navigate and provides a comprehensive overview of my abilities.

            The project involved creating a simple website that demonstrated the ’FLAMES’ game, which
            is used to predict a hypothetical relationship between two people. The website was built using HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript, and featured a basic user interface for entering the names of the two people and calculating
            the result. CSS was used to style the website, while JavaScript handled the calculations and displayed the
            result. The project provided a fun and interactive way to explore the concept of the FLAMES game.
